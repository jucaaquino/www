![Juca Aquino Portrait](/images/portrait.jpg)

Juca Aquino is a painter currently living and working in Winnipeg MB. Born in
SÃ£o Paulo and raised by architect parents, Juca draws from Brazilian Modernist
architecture, landscaping and painting. In Juca's most recent body of work "All
of the Above," he used mediums like silkscreen, relief printing and spray
painting. These techniques allowed him to expedite the painting process,
while also allowing for improvisation and imprecision. He produced over
200 paintings some of which were exhibited at La Maison des artistes visuels
francophones, School of Art Student Gallery (University of Manitoba) and Martha
Street Studio. Juca has worked for Plug In ICA as a private contractor and for
Winnipeg Film Group as a coding workshop instructor.
