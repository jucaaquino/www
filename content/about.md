![Juca Aquino Portrait](/images/portrait.jpg)

Juca Aquino is a Brazilian-Canadian artist currently studying at the University
of Manitoba. Juca’s artistic practice is informed by Brazilian art and
architecture like the Copacabana boardwalk, Ibirapuera Park and the skyscrapers
on Paulista avenue. He first became interested in screenprinting when he saw
Takashi Murakami’s maximalist murals at a retrospective in the Vancouver Art
Gallery. Juca became fascinated with using code as a tool for creating visual
art when he noticed that unintended results caused by bugs in the code are
often more compelling than the intended results. Juca has done volunteering
work for the Winnipeg Art Gallery, Plug In ICA and Art City.

Juca was born in São Paulo in 2004 and currently lives and works in Winnipeg, MB, Canada.

Imogene Strauss is a multidisciplinary creative director and designer. Born in
New York City, she lives and works in Los Angeles. Raised by artist parents and
constantly surrounded by inspiration, Imogene began working in the arts in her
early 20s managing Solange and Blood Orange and serving as a music
curator—notably of the legendary MoMA PS1 WarmUp series—alongside other
projects. Her work as a creative director evolved naturally out of the deep
artistic relationships she fostered with her management clients. 



M.E. Sparks (she/her) is an artist and educator currently living in Winnipeg,
MB, Treaty 1 Territory. Sparks works primarily with paint and canvas. Through a
practice of pulling apart and recombining borrowed forms, both art historical
and autobiographical, she looks for the moment an image loses its
representational solidity. Recently, she has been exploring material
possibilities of un-stretched painted canvas. Paintings are cut apart, layered
and draped in an effort to obstruct and reimagine both the pictorial space of
painting and its historical narrative.

Sparks holds an MFA from Emily Carr University (Vancouver) and BFA from NSCAD
University (Halifax). She is a recipient of project and research grants from
Canada Council for the Arts, Winnipeg Arts Council, BC Arts Council, and Arts
Nova Scotia. Recent exhibitions include and a Rag in the Other at the
Alternator Centre for Contemporary Art (Kelowna, 2022), We can only hint at
this with words at the Gordon Smith Gallery of Canadian Art (North Vancouver,
2022) and A Fine Line at Trapp Projects (Vancouver, 2021).
Raised by architect parents.
